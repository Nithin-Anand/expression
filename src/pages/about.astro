            Hello there! My name is Nithin, and I am an amateur photographer,
            shooting regularly since 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
            I still have lots to learn about photography, so I wanted to create
            this page to show you my progress over time. I take a camera
            everywhere I go, shooting street (as I live in London), travel and
            daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Away from the camera, most of my time is spent working as a software
            engineer. I also enjoy reading, bouldering, visiting exhibitions and
            travelling!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're interested in the gear I use, all the details can be found <a
                href="/gear">here.</a

        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to take a look some <a href="/stats">nerdy stats</a> about
            the photos on this site.
